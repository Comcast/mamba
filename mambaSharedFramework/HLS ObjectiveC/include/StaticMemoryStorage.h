/**
 Minimal memory storage wrapper.
 
 This class takes a NSData instance and makes a static copy of the memory for reference.
 
 StaticMemoryStorage will allocate and deallocate this memory on initialization and deinitialization,
 respectively.
 
 This is done so that mamba can construct `HLSStringRef` objects that refer to this static memory
 storage. See `HLSPlaylistCore` for where we keep a reference to this `StaticMemoryStorage` object.
