/**
 Interprets a CMTime value from string.
 @param string A null-terminated UTF-8 string from which to read the CMTime value.
 @param decimal_places The number of figures after the decimal place to be preserved. Must be [0-9] (inclusive).
 @param remainder An optional pointer. If remainder is non-null, a pointer to the first unrecognized character will be stored on output.
 This value will be set even if an invalid time is returned.
 @return A CMTime value, or an invalid CMTime if the string could not be interpreted. Use CMTIME_IS_VALID to check. A zero-length
 string is considered invalid.
 @note Leading whitespace will be ignored. This function does not check for over/underflow, as the 64-bit value of CMTime is unlikely to overflow.
 The format recognized by this function can be described with the following regular expression.
 @code \s*-?[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?
