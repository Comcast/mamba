 @warning If this string cannot be parsed, an invalid CMTime is returned. You can test a CMTime using the
 CMTIME_IS_VALID() and CMTIME_IS_INVALID() functions. Calling CMTimeGetSeconds() on an invalid time will return NaN (not 0).
 
 @discussion This method only examines the first 7 bytes of the string. In practice, EXTINF durations are usually shorter than 7
 characters (including the decimal place). If you require more precision, use a different method to parse.
 
 This method does not strictly enforce the EXTINF tag specification, but any string which conforms will be parsed
 correctly. This is not a general purpose "to double" method and rejects negative numbers amongst other valid doubles.
