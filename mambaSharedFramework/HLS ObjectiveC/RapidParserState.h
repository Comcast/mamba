 Parse State Machine:
 
 We start in the Scanning state. We scan through each character in the 
 playlist in reverse and move to different states based on that character.
 
 We may take other actions based on the character value, but those are not
 part of the state machine and are not documented here. The actions taken
 per character are found in the `masterParseArray`.
 
 Note that there is a special state ErrorEarlyExit. This is triggered when we find an error
 that forces us to stop parsing. This is a "final" state, and we exit the loop when we 
 hit it. There is not an entry in the `masterParseArray` for this state since we
 immediately exit when we find it.
 
 The other exit condition is when we run out of characters.
